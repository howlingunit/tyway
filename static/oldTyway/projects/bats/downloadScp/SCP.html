<p id="et">these files are for communication with this server which also acts as a repository for project dark hallway on port 22<br><br> 
    ssh syntax:<br>
    repository@tyway.net<br><br>
    the dir to the files:<br>
    C:\Users\repository\repository\<br><br>
    in the programs files should be writen like this:<br>
    /path/to/file/<br><br>
    .sh files are for linux and .bat files are for windows<br><br>
    run files in linux like this:<br>
    ./file.sh<br><br>
    Note: The download may not work in Edge version 12, IE, Safari 10 (and earlier), or Opera version 12 (and earlier).<br><br>
    If this is a problem for you then get google chrome or Firefox they both work well and so what if they're spying on you, that just means that they're going to give you personalised ads  so just chill.<br><br>
And if getting chrome is still a problem for you then feel free to hack your way in and leave a msg on the home page and just steel the files  :)
