<h1>how to do html
</h1>
<h3>by Tyler Pitt</h3>
<h3> for People</h3>
<h3>(do mind my spelling i was young when i did this)</h3> 
<h2> 1st bit </h2>
<P>this is how to do a html script, so first you put html in arows i can't show you<br>
because it will mess up the programing. Then you go down to the next line and<br>
you put /html in arows.You must put all your programing imbtween these two <br>
lines </p>
<h2>title</h2>
<p> for the actual code imbtween the opening and heading lines you'll need a heading <br>
for this you'll have to put head in arrows and on the bottom line put /head in arrows <br>
imbtween the lines you need to put title in arrows then put your title and put <br>
/title in arrows and then you have a title </p>
<h2>body</h2>
<p>now this is how to do the body of your html script for this you need to put body in arows (side note:<br>
you can change the color of the screen and text be typing in the same arows as body (this is for the back ground)<br>
bgcolor="c color eg green" (for the text) text="a color eg yellow" (please remember not all colors will work)<P>
<p>now press enter and put in arows /body and imbtween these 2 lines of code type your main script<p>
<h2>sub titles</h2>

<p>now for sub titles its quite easy all you do is put h a number eg h2(the smaller the<br>
number the bigger the text eg h1 is masive howerver h7 is small) then put in your text<br>
and in arrows put /h your number </p>
<h2>paragraphs</h2>
<p>paragraphs are probaly the easiest one all you need to do is put p in arrows and then put /p in arrows<br>
howerver it will not go to the next line atomaticly to do this you need <br>
to put br in arrows and go to the next line and your done</p>
